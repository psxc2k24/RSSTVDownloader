This small gui-app replaces adding filters and regex to rss-feeds in you torrent client.
features include
- point and click bookmarks for tv-shows
- auto-downloading and opening .torrent files
- auto-downloading out-of-order episode-releases
- auto-downloading the same release from different sites/feeds (auto-trading)
- auto-downloading of repacks/propers

Work in progress - currently in beta. Expect frequent updates.
Only three sites supported for now - adding more should be easy but require urls and rss-samples
